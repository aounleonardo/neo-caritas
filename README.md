## What

## How

### Blockchain

We used [neo-scan-docker](https://github.com/slipo/neo-scan-docker), deployable
with a `simple docker-compose up -d` :ok_hand:

We'll let you deploy the contract by yourself, probably with the help of the
[neo-python](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python) prompt

### Frontend

Frontend built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

Just open or serve the index.html and you're set :sunglasses:
