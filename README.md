# neo-caritas

## What

**Neo Caritas** is a smart contract on the [NEO](https://neo.org) blockchain

The goal is to provide a **reliable income** to NGOs leveraging the GAS
generation property of the NEO blockchain

A person willing to give will lock his NEO in the smart contract for a set
number of blocks (here for example a million, or about 6 months) and all the
GAS generated by the sum will be claimable by the NGO, while the deposited sum
will be given back to the owner after the chosen time has passed

We have partenered with
[Goodwill Children's Homes](http://www.goodwillhomes.org.uk/), a formidable NGO
that provides education, medical care and security to destitute children in
south India (Tamil Nadu)

Please have a look at their work

## How

### Blockchain

We used [neo-scan-docker](https://github.com/slipo/neo-scan-docker), deployable
with a `simple docker-compose up -d` :ok_hand:

We'll let you deploy the contract by yourself, probably with the help of the
[neo-python](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python) prompt

### Frontend

Frontend built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

Just open or serve the index.html and you're set :sunglasses:

You'll also need to change the hardcoded constants in `App.js` :innocent:
